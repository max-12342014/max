        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m [Your Name], a passionate coder and aspiring writer. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me playing video games, honing my skills in ping pong, practicing kung fu, or swimming. Each of these interests fuels my creativity and keeps me motivated.</p>
        
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I love diving into the world of programming, exploring new languages, and building projects that challenge my skills. Whether it's developing a simple app or experimenting with game development, coding is my way of expressing ideas and solving problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>Gaming is more than just a pastime for me; it's a source of inspiration. I enjoy exploring different genres, from action to strategy, and I often find myself analyzing game mechanics and storytelling techniques.</p>
        
        <h3>Ping Pong and Kung Fu</h3>
        <p>Ping pong keeps me agile and focused, while kung fu teaches me discipline and perseverance. Both sports help me stay active and bring balance to my life.</p>
        
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>Swimming is another passion of mine. It’s not just a great workout; it also provides a sense of tranquility. I love the feeling of being in the water and the freedom it brings.</p>
        
        <h3>Poetry</h3>
        <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a passion for writing poetry. Crafting words into verses allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in unique ways. I believe that poetry can illuminate the beauty in everyday life.</p>
        
        <p>I’m excited to share my journey on Medium, where I’ll be writing about coding, gaming, sports, and my reflections through poetry. Join me as I explore these passions and connect with fellow enthusiasts!</p>
